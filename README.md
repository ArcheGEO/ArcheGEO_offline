ArcheGEO_offline is the offline pipeline of ArcheGEO and is responsible for setting up the PostgreSQL database with data from NCI Thesaurus, NCI Metathesaurus and Cellosaurus. 
It is coded using Python 3.8 (PyCharm Community 2020.2). Note that you should run ArcheGEO_offline first before using ArcheGEO_online.
Note that the data folder contains large files that are required for ArcheGEO_offline. These files are uploaded to Github using Git Large File Storage (https://git-lfs.github.com/)
Refer to readme.docx for the architecture framework of ArcheGEO_offline, how to run it and where to obtain the data files.
