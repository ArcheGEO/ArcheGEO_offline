ArcheGEO_offline is the offline pipeline of ArcheGEO and is responsible for setting up the PostgreSQL database with data from NCI Thesaurus, NCI Metathesaurus and Cellosaurus. 
It is coded using Python 3.8 (PyCharm Community 2020.2). Note that you should run ArcheGEO_offline first before using ArcheGEO_online.
Note that ArcheGEO_offline requires several large data files in order to run. These files are too large to upload to Github. Please refer to readme.docx for where to obtain these files and also for the architecture framework of ArcheGEO_offline and how to run it. After the large data files are obtained, they should be stored in a folder (named "data") that is created at the same level as the "configuration" folder in the ArcheGEO_offline project.
